== Branches ==

"development" - the latest code
"master" - the last 'stable' code

i.e. If you want to check out the latest, grab "development."

== Building ==

To build Monocle, use one of the included project files.

If there is no project file for your platform, generate one automatically using Premake4.

See: http://industriousone.com/premake

Windows:
To run on Windows, make sure working directory is set to:

$(SolutionDir)..\..\..\Build\bin\

Mac OSX:
Make sure you're using XCode version 4 and that you have the shared Scheme selected.

Tests:
Change premake4 commandline to build a project file with tests included.

== Test Controls ==

Updated test controls coming soon...
